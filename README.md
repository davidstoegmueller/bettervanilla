### Translations

Edit these YAML files to customize player-facing text; changes are applied after the next plugin/server restart. Existing translation files are preserved when the plugin updates.

## Permissions

### Built-in Groups

- `player` - default fallback that grants all player-facing QoL features such as `/settings`, waypoints, backpacks, and automation toggles.
- `moderator` - inherits the player group and adds moderation, vanish, inventory viewing, and timer controls.
- `admin` - includes every BetterVanilla permission, covering server maintenance, admin settings, and permission management.
- Use `/permissions default <group>` (e.g. `/permissions default player`) to choose which group new players fall back to. Switching the default moves existing players that still belonged to the previous default.
